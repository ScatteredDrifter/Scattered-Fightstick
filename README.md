# The Scattered-Fightstick
---

A fightstick supporting the Brook Universal Fighting Board, a detachable joystick  and hitbox layout


Designed it with Fusion 360 Education - will upload the files soon. 

## Features:

- support for Brook Universal Fighting Board (https://www.brookaccessory.com/detail/06960737/)
- supports Sanwa Joystick ( https://focusattack.com/sanwa-jlfd-tp-8yt-detachable-joystick-lever/ ) 
- support for Hitbox Layout / more of a hybrid
- three option-buttons on the back 
- a 5 degree bottom piece ( Totsugeki inprint , can be replaced in Fusion 360 )
- cut in half to support the buildplate of a Creality Ender 3 

## Current state:

- prototype is working correctly, although slight modifications were necessary ( build can be seen on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/fightsticks/comments/qbelww/i_built_my_first_fightstick_3dprinted_case_and/ ) 
- better mounting planned > similar to top-mount for keyboards - for a more rigid and sturdy plate 
- maybe adding support for LEDs at some point 
- rev2 ought to be a more compact version of this design
- the mount for the upper plate is horrible, I have to fix it in a new revision

## How to assemble:

- print everything on your preferred printer
- fuse the bottom, case, plate and top plate with glue or an iron + Pla.
- insert buttons, attach the joystick and wire everything up
- screw everything together with M3 screws - for the top - and M4 screws for the bottom 
- You should be done
